# DPP for recommandation

### Subset selection appears in many applications like recommendation (Gillenwater et al. 2014), document summarization (Kulesza and Taskar 2011b; Lin and Bilmes 2012), and Web search (Kulesza and Taskar 2011a).
The principal problematic is how to select a good subset that contains high quality, and distinct items.
We may consider the example of Amazon, a user should be recommended with a subset with high-predicted rating and diversity. 
The best way to combine between quality and diversity of set is the use of Determinantal point processes (DPPs).
Our work was based on the following article :
